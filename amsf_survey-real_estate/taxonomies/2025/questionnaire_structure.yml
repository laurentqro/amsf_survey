            instructions: |
              Report only information where you or your entity acted as a professional representative within the meaning of law n° 1.362 for Real Estate purchases, sales, or rentals, within the reporting period.

              For example, rental clients that have monthly rent of < 10,000 Euro should be excluded from this total.

              If multiple primary nationalities, enter the one most commonly used.

              Report only information for activities which are not being claimed by another entity which you represented and who is also responding to this SICCFIN Real Estate AML/CFT Survey.

              For questions referring to 'unique client', please consider:

              - If the same client has several transactions, then it is considered one client
              - If the entity provides multiple services or has multiple contracts with the same client, then it is considered one client
              - Any other situation where the same client would be double counted, please consider as one client

              - field_id: "a1101"

                question_number: 5
                instructions: |
                  For clarity:

                  If a client purchases one property but makes 2 transfers to achieve full payment of the property, this shall be counted as 1 property transaction.

                  The purchase of units or shares of a real estate company constitutes as many transactions as there are purchases or sales (e.g. purchase of 10 shares = 1 transaction; a purchase of 10 shares then a another purchase of 15 shares = 2 transactions; sale of 100% of the shares of an SCI = 1 transaction).

                  For rentals, one transaction shall mean one month- rent equivalent ( >= 10,000 Euros). A rental client making monthly payments for one full year would be 12 transactions. A rental client making one payment covering 12 months' rent shall be counted as 12 transactions.
